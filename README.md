 # Face Detection Using OpenCV with Raspberry Pi 
**This Repository will explain my 4th task in Robotics and AI department at [SMART METHODS](https://github.com/smart-methods) summer training.**

## Task Requirements: 
  - Use OpenCV for making a real time face detection and recognition in Raspberry Pi.
  
## Detailed Steps:
1. Configure the Raspbeery Pi to control the Pi remotely [(Click Here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpJCAafw2qE&t=1201s)

2. Create your Python virtual environment and install NumPy and Compile OpenCV 4 from source [(Click Here for full details)](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/09/16/install-opencv-4-on-raspberry-pi-4-and-raspbian-buster/)..

3. Test the camera using this code [here full details with commenet]().
  * Run the virtual environment 'workon cv'
  * open the path file if you have svaed your py file in a directory using `cd` command, in my case I will run the folowing command `cd Face_Recognition/Face_Detection` 
  * Run you camera test file by using `python` folowed by your file name, in my case `python Face_Detection.py`
  * I will use a usb camera as shown in the figure <p align='left'><img width="30%" src="https://github.com/mo7ammed-saleh/Face_Detection_using_RPi/blob/main/img/Camera_usage.jpg"/>
    </p>
  * Tested resut will show an image in a gray and rgb color <p align='left'><img width="80%" src="https://github.com/mo7ammed-saleh/Face_Detection_using_RPi/blob/main/img/Test_Camera.jpg"/>
